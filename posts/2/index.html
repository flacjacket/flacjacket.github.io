  <div class="entry-content"><p>This last week, I have made progress on my project working on laying the base
work for the spin states and in reimplementing logic in the <code>cg_simp</code> method
for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.</p>

<p>First, I have started the work on the implementation of coupled/uncoupled spin
states. Currently, this is implemented by adding a <code>coupled</code> property to the
spin states. This can be set to True for coupled, False for uncoupled or left
as None for other states. As this evolves, I will move to having uncoupled
product states be represented by a TensorProduct of two spin states. The next
key will be establishing represent and rewrite logic for these spin states.
Part of this will be figuring out how exactly these methods will work and what
they will return. Namely, the represent method, noting that when representing
an uncoupled state as a coupled state, it returns states with multiple j
values, which under the current logic, would return matrices of different
dimension. Also, we will have to determine what represent will do to uncoupled
tensor product spin states. This next week, I will likely rebase this branch
against the CG branch so I can start using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to
implement these functions as the CG pull is finalized.</p>

<p>With the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, this last week I was able to get the
simplification of symbolic Sum objects working. I did this using the pattern
matching built into sympy with Wild and .match. The final step with this should
be to rework the logic of <code>_cg_simp_add</code> to make it easier to add in additional
symmetries.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This last week, the first thing that was taken care of was finishing the x/y/z
spin basis representation. Having fixed the Wigner small d-function in the
Rotation class, the tests for this were put into the pull request and the pull
was merged into the sympy master, making this my first pull request since
starting GSoC. There is still some changes that will come for the Rotation
class, namely the creation of a symbolic WignerD class which is returned by the
current Rotation.D and Rotation.d functions, but that will be dealt with in a
later pull request.</p>

<p>With the x/y/z basis stuff finally out of the way, I moved back to getting the
Glebsch-Gordan coefficient/Wigner-3j symbols to a state where they can be
pulled. Having fallen behind in getting the CG coefficient simplification to a
suitable state and with the work on the x/y/z spin basis pushing the timeline
back even further, the current goal is to merge what I have so far and move on
to the coupled spin states. What I have so far is the classes for the Wigner-3j
symbols and the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients which can be manipulated
symbolically and evaluated, and a very rough version of the cg_simp method.
Currently, this method can handle 3 numerical simplification, however the code
is still messy and having more cases would be ideal. That said, in an effort to
make sure the key parts of this GSoC project are covered, I&rsquo;ll be moving into
writing the coupled spin states.</p>

<p>For the spin states portion of this project, I will develop a means of writing
coupled and uncoupled spin states. The uncoupled product basis states will be
written using the TensorProduct, which is in the current quantum module; each
of the states in the tensor product will be states as they are currently
implemented. To represent coupled basis spin states, the current spin states
will be modified to included a coupled parameter. This value stores the J_i&rsquo;s
of the spin spaces which are being coupled. In addition to the spin states
being implemented, methods will be written to utilize the CG coefficients
mentioned earlier to go between coupled and uncoupled basis representation.
Look for more next week as this code is fleshed out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the first part of this last week, I continued on my work to get sums of
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to simplify. Using the same general logic that I
outlined in the last blog entry, besides general cleaning up of the code, most
of the work at the beginning of the week was spent on trying to develop a
function that could check an expression for CG coefficients matching a set of
conditions.</p>

<p>The rationale behind trying to write such a method is that it would make it
much easier to identify the times where symmetries could be utilized. With
such a method, the process of checking for CG coefficients could be done in a
single function and the logic for implementing CG symmetries could be handled
in this one function. The current method uses lists of tuples to specify the
conditions on CG coefficients. For example, if the j1 value of a CG coefficient
needed to be =0, you could pass the tuple (&ldquo;j1&rdquo;,0), or if the m1 and m3 values
match (&ldquo;m1&rdquo;,&ldquo;m3&rdquo;). All the conditions for each CG coefficient are combined into
a single tuple. The current snag with simplifications of sums of products of CG
coefficients. For example:
$$ \sum_{\alpha,\beta} C_{\alpha\beta}^{c\gamma} C_{\alpha\beta}^{c&#8217;\gamma&#8217;}
= \delta_{cc&#8217;} \delta_{\gamma\gamma&#8217;} $$</p>

<p>While the current method would be able to check for specific values on the CG
coefficients, I have yet to come up with a good way to check that the m1 and m2
values are the same when they can take any value, as in this example. As it
stands, this code still seems like quite a hack and will need some work before
it is good to go.</p>

<p>What is left with this part of the project is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Getting simplification to work with sums of products of terms (as in the example above)</li>
<li>Applying CG symmetries to perform simplifications</li>
<li>Simplification of symbolic CG sums</li>
<li>Fixing up the printing of CG terms</li>
<li>Final testing/documentation</li>
</ul>


<p>This part of the project has unfortunately fallen behind the preliminary
schedule by a bit, as it was due to be finished up last week. I&rsquo;ll outline what
I&rsquo;m currently working on finish up next, but hopefully I can finish the CG
stuff ASAP so I can move on to working on the spin stuff which is the true meat
of the project and try to get back on schedule.</p>

<p>After meeting with my project mentor, Ondrej, on Wednesday, it was decided that
the focus would shift to finishing up the work I&rsquo;d started on x/y/z spin bases
and representation of spin states that I&rsquo;d started before GSoC had officially
started.</p>

<p>The first order of business was identifying an error in the Wigner small-d
function, which is used extensively in the changing of spin bases. With Ondrej
noting that the small-d function was defined only on a small interval and then
me discovering the bug in the Rotation.d method, we were able to address this.
However, no sooner had this been done than Ondrej is able to work out a better
equation for the small-d function, which will likely replace the current
implementation.</p>

<p>Other than this, most of the work this week on the x/y/z basis representation
was in documentation, testing and generally cleaning up the code to be pulled.
The current pull request (my first work to be submitted since the start of
GSoC) is still open <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/431">here</a>.  While
this pull integrates the current work on basis representation, after this pull
there is still some work that will need to be done testing both the Wigner
small-d and the D functions, for both symbolic and numerical values, and
ensuring they return the correct results. Because the representation code
relies so heavily on these functions, it is imperative that these functions
evaluate properly. Once these are fully tested, there will also likely need to
be more tests to ensure all the representation code returns the right values
for as many odd cases as would be necessary to test. Hopefully I can finish
this up soon and move on to other work that still needs to be done.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was out of town for the beginning of this week, so I don&rsquo;t have as much to
report, nevertheless in the last few days, I have made some good improvements
to the cg_simp method, allowing it to simplify cases other than just the simple
sums, tho it still only handles the same case as before involving the sum of .
While it is entirely possible I&rsquo;m doing something stupid in performing all the
checks, as far as I can tell, it works for the given case. Because the code
itself is not yet very clear and it is not always straightforward what is
happening, I&rsquo;ll explain what I have implemented.</p>

<p>First note that for the simplifications that will be made, it is required to
have a sum of terms. The first for loop in the method constructs two lists
<code>cg_part</code> and <code>other_part</code>, the former consisting of all terms of the sum
containing a CG coefficient and the latter the other terms.</p>

<p>Next, we iterate over the list <code>cg_part</code>. The number of CG coefficients is
computed, which determines which simplifications can be made (currently, the
only implemented simplification uses terms with 1 CG coefficient in each sum
term).  Those terms with the proper number of CG coefficients are then
considered for the simplification. The way this will work is: based on the
properties of the CG coefficient in the term, it will search the rest of the
list for other terms that can be used in the simplification, and if all the
terms exist, will simplify the terms.</p>

<p>Turning to the implementation, when iterating through the list, the first thing
to do is determine the properties of the CG coefficient terms, that is to
extract from the term in the sum the CG coefficient itself and the numerical
leading terms. Here it is also noted the sign of these numerical terms.</p>

<p>Next, the rest of the list is checked to see if a simplification can be made
using the determined term. To keep track of this, a list, <code>cg_index</code>, is
initialized with <code>False</code> as the element of the list. In checking the later
terms, we preform a similar decomposition as with the first term, that is
splitting up the CG coefficient from the other components of the term,
determining the CG coefficient, the leading terms and the sign of the terms. If
the properties of these are correct, then the corresponding element of
<code>cg_index</code> is updated with a tuple <code>(term, cg, coeff)</code> where term is the term
in <code>cg_part</code> (so this element can be removed later), the CG coefficient and the
leading numerical coefficient of the coefficient.</p>

<p>Now, if all the elements of <code>cg_index</code> are changed, the simplification is
preformed. When this happens, first we find the minimum coefficient of the
chosen CG coefficients, which determines the number of times we can apply the
simplification. Then the replacing happens; for each element in <code>cg_index</code>
(which is a tuple) the first element of the tuple is popped off <code>cg_part</code>,
then, if the term is not eliminated by the simplification, a new term is
created and added to <code>cg_part</code>, and finally a constant is added to
<code>other_part</code>, completing the simplification.</p>

<p>Looking at the code, this method is very straightforward, but should be robust
and scalable for treating cases of sums with numerical leading coefficients,
and now that the i&rsquo;s have been dotted and the t&rsquo;s have been crossed on testing
this method, implementing new cases should come rapidly in the next couple
days.  However, one place where this will still need some work is in
implementing symbolic simplification, both in dealing with symbolic leading
terms on the CG coefficients and symbolic CG coefficients themselves. This will
take a bit of thought and likely a bit of help to complete, but this is one
thing I hope to work on in the next week. In addition, as the simplification
comes into place, I&rsquo;ll work on polishing out the last of the details to get the
classes for the Wigner3j/CG coefficients working properly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this first week of the GSoC project, I focused on implementing methods that
would simplify terms with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This still has a long
was to go, but I will outline what I have done so far.</p>

<p>The first step was implementing means of dealing with sums of single
coefficients. This would hopefully look something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">Sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">GC</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">alpha</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The first implementation of this used an indexing system that was able to index
single coefficients, which could then be processed. This allowed the
simplification function to act properly in simple numerical cases, so it could
do things like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">3</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The problem with this implementation is doing something as simple as having one
of the terms have a constant coefficient would break it. In addition, there
would be no clear way to extend this to sums involving products of multiple
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.</p>

<p>To deal with this, I started working a solution that could deal with having
constant coefficients and products of coefficients. Currently implemented is
method which creates list of tuples containing information about the
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the leading coefficients of the Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients. Currently, the only implemented logic is only able to deal with
the case in that could be dealt with in the previous implementation, however,
this should be able to expand to encompass more exotic cases.</p>

<p>Another thing that was touched on this last week was treating symmetries. These
are quite simple to implement, as they need only return new Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients in place of old ones, just with the parameters changed in
correspondence with the symmetry operation. The key will be using these
symmetries to help in simplifying terms. This will be based on the development
of better logic in the simplification method and the implementation of some
means of determining if these symmetries can be used to apply some property of
the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients that can simplify the expression.</p>

<p>I will be out of town this next week on a vacation, and will not be able to get
work in, but I will continue working on this when I return, with the intention
of getting it to a state that can be pushed within the next couple weeks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week marks the official start of the Google Summer of Code. While I
started getting my feet wet last week after finishing the last of my finals and
grading, the bulk of the work has just started turning out. I&rsquo;ll quick cover
what I have from this last week and what I&rsquo;m looking to get working this week.</p>

<p>Before the start, I worked out expanding the functionality of the currently
implemented x/y/z bases, which work I have
<a href="https://github.com/flacjacket/sympy/tree/xyz_bases">here</a>. The previous
implementation only allowed for evaluating inner products between states in the
same basis and representing the states in the Jz basis and then only with j=&frac12;
states. Using the Wigner D-function, implemented with the Rotation class, I
implemented represent to go between the x/y/z bases for any j values. Both
<code>_eval_innerproduct</code> and <code>_rewrite_as</code> were then created to take advantage of the
represent function to extend the functionality of the inner product and to
implement rewrite between any bases and any arbitrary j values.</p>

<p>This seems like this is some documentation and tests away from being pushed,
but there is something buggy with the Rotation.d function, implementing the
Wigner small d-matrix. I noticed when trying to do</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">qapply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">JzBra</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">JzKet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rewrite</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;Jx&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and I wasn&rsquo;t getting the right answer. As it turns out, the Rotation.d
function, which uses Varshalovich 4.3.2 Eq 7, does not give the right answer
for <code>Rotation.d(1,1,0,-pi/2)</code> or <code>Rotation.d(1,0,1,pi/2)</code>. Namely, there is
something wrong with the equation that doesn&rsquo;t change the sign of the matrix
element when reversing the sign of the beta Euler angle. Running all four
differential representations given by Varshalovich for the small d matrix, Eq
7-10, give the wrong result, so the derivations of these will need to be
checked to fix this. I have a bug report up
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=2423">here</a>.</p>

<p>As for what I will be implementing this week, I already have the basics of the
Wigner3j and CG class implemented, the work for this going up
<a href="https://github.com/flacjacket/sympy/tree/cg_coeff">here</a>. This includes
creating the objects, <em>some</em> of the printing functionality and numerical
evaluation of the elements using the wigner.py functions. The meat of the class
that I&rsquo;m currently working on is the <code>cg_simp</code> function, which will simplify
expressions of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. I currently have one case working,
that is <code>Sum(CG(a,alpha,0,0,a,alpha),(alpha,-a,a)) == 2a+1</code> which is
Varshalovich 8.7.1 Eq 1. There are still some things to smooth out with the
implementation, but I should have that worked out a bit better, in addition to
some more simplifications by the end of the week.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I have for now, watch for updates within the week as to what I&rsquo;ve
gotten done and what I have yet to do.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hi all,</p>

<p>This adventure into blogging is to document the work I will be doing this
summer with <a href="http://sympy.org/">SymPy</a>, an open source symbolic mathematics
library written in Python. The project will be done as a part of the
<a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> program. This summer, I
will be developing a symbolic class for creating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
and will develop the spin algebra in the existing quantum physics module to
utilize these coefficients. The gory details can be read in my
<a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC%202011%20Application%20Sean%20Vig">application</a>.
My mentor for this project will be Ondřej Čertík. The project officially starts
May 24, but I&rsquo;ll be diving in once I finish up the last of my finals May
14.  I will be documenting my progress on the project throughout the summer
through this blog, and anyone interested in this is free to watch for
updates once the project is underway.  All my work will be pushed to
<a href="https://github.com/flacjacket/sympy">my SymPy fork</a> on github.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough for now, I&rsquo;ll be checking back in once I get started in the
summer. Now, back to trying to graduate.</p>
