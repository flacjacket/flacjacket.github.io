Well, I've moved my [old blog](https://seanvig.blogspot.com/) here, to my
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) page.  I've done this for several
reasons, many of which are mirrored accross the web, but in short, being able
to hack at my blog generator is great.  Integration of nice Jekyll plugins to
deal with things like syntax highlighting, being able to write in Markdown,
easy inclusion of MathJax, being able to write blog posts in vim, the list goes
on.  I haven't really done any configuration, for the most part, I dropped in
the default [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) configuration with minimal
changes to get my name everywhere and imported my old blog (which included
going in and adding Markdown syntax to all the files, ick). That stuff can all
be pulled from the
[source branch](https://github.com/flacjacket/flacjacket.github.io/tree/source)
of my pages branch.

I realize I haven't done anything with this blog in a long time, but maybe I
can put up some new stuff I've been hacking on now that I've got this new page.
