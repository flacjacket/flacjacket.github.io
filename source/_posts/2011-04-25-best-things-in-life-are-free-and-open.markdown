Hi all,

This adventure into blogging is to document the work I will be doing this
summer with [SymPy](http://sympy.org/), an open source symbolic mathematics
library written in Python. The project will be done as a part of the
[Google Summer of Code](http://socghop.appspot.com/) program. This summer, I
will be developing a symbolic class for creating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
and will develop the spin algebra in the existing quantum physics module to
utilize these coefficients. The gory details can be read in my
[application](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/GSoC%202011%20Application%20Sean%20Vig).
My mentor for this project will be Ondřej Čertík. The project officially starts
May 24, but I'll be diving in once I finish up the last of my finals May
14.  I will be documenting my progress on the project throughout the summer
through this blog, and anyone interested in this is free to watch for
updates once the project is underway.  All my work will be pushed to
[my SymPy fork](https://github.com/flacjacket/sympy) on github.


That's enough for now, I'll be checking back in once I get started in the
summer. Now, back to trying to graduate.
